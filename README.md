# SQSnobFit with ZeroMQ Objective Function

This project employs SQSnobFit to optimize a function calculated remotely. This is done by providing SQSnobFit with an objective function that sends parameters to and receives function values from a remote calculator using ZeroMQ message queues. NOTE: The function provider must be running and ready to accept messages before this program is run, or this program will hang on the first request.

# Installation

It is recommended that dependencies are installed using a virtual environment,
or `venv`, and this is required if using `make`. All of the following commands
are executed from the top level directory of the project (where this README.md
file is).

## With `make`

1. Set up a virtual environment with:
   ```
   make venv
   ```

2. Install dependencies with:
   ```
   make install
   ```

3. The program can now be run with:
   ```
   make run
   ```
   * But make sure the function provider is running and ready to accept messages first!

## Without `make`

1. Set up a virtual environment with:
   ```
   python -m venv ./venv
   ```

2. Activate the virtual environment:
   ```
   source ./venv/bin/activate
   ```
   or for Windows:
   ```
   .\venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Run the program as follows to generate a default config file (which you can then edit):
   ```
   python ./src/main.py myconfig.json --default-config
   ```
   or, use an existing config file with:
   ```
   python ./src/main.py <existing_config.json>
   ```

5. Deactivate the virtual environment when you are finished by typing:
   ```
   deactivate
   ```
